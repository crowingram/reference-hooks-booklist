# reference-hooks-booklist

This project is based on a tutorial series ["React Context & Hooks Tutorial"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hNokByJilPg5g9m2APUePI) in 21 parts from [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg).

The original tutorial goes into explanation of class version of context then how to convert that to hooks syntax.

The finished project uses useState, useContext, useReducer, and useEffect hooks.

The final run-through was fast enough that I didn't stop to commit often enough. This project is worth rebuilding with more atomic commits for reference. Still, the finished project is readable enough to be valuable without frequent commits.
